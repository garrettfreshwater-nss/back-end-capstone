PetCare is a ASP.Net Core / Entity Framework web application built for Animal Hospital in Farragut, Tennessee. PetCare has full CRUD functionality that allows Pet Owners and Veterinarians to add pets being treated and track pet care along while eliminating any oversight that can arise from the day to day hustle.  

Pet Owners have the ability to add pets and add notes for their pets for their own reference or Veterinarian reference.  Pets and Notes can be edited and deleted. Owners have the ability to add the Veterinarian that takes care of their pets to their Pets.

Veterinarians have the ability to add pets and add notes for Owners pets for their own reference or Veterinarian reference.  Pets and Notes can be edited and deleted. Veterinarians have special permissions when it comes to edit/delete of notes/pets.
